# booksuggest
A webapp to suggest books based on your recent favorites.

This is a Flask webapp that uses Google search API to compile a list of books you might like to read based on a book you enter. 
It's a work in progress, so feel free to make suggestions. I'm looking for ways to access Amazon recommendations without scraping.
